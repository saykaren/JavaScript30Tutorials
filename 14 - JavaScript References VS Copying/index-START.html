    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players;

    //console.log(players, team);

    // team[3] = 'Karen';

    // console.log(players, team);
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    team2[3] = 'Karen';

    // console.log({players}, {team2});
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    team4[2] = "HelloGeorge";
    // console.log({team4}, {players});

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = "aaron";
    //console.log({team5}, {players})
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
     // captain.number = 99;
     // console.log({person}, {captain});

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 17});

    console.log({person}, {captain2});
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.number = 3;

    console.log({cap3}, {person});
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
const karen = {
  name: 'Karen',
  age: 100,
  social:{
    website: "saykaren.com",
  }
}

const karen2 = {...karen};
karen2.age = 21;

console.log({karen}, {karen2});

const karenTesting = {...karen};
karenTesting.social.website = "cool";

    console.log({karen}, {karenTesting});
// Need to do clone deep to be able to change nested items
    // otherwise those are referencing the original object and will adjust it.
 const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(karen)); // he doesn't recommend it
 dev2.social.website = 'did it change?';
